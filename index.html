 <h1>Welcome To My Capstone Project</h1>
<p>A capstone project aims to demonstrate a student's mastery of a particular subject or field of study. It is typically a culminating project that integrates and applies the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course of a degree program.</p>

 <h2>The meaning of CAPSTONE is a coping stone : coping. How to use capstone in a sentence. </h2>
<p>The term derives from the final decorative coping or "cap-stone" used to complete a building or monument. In higher education, the term has been in common use in the United States since the mid-twentieth century, although there is evidence that it was in use as early as the late 1800s.</p>

<h3>Capstone Project Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>At the completion of the course, the students must demonstrate to attain the following Course Learning Outcomes and Students Outcomes.</p>
<p>Course Learning Outcomes:</p>
<p>Define design objectives, design constraints and product specifications according to the stakeholder and project requirements.
Collect and review related data such as technical information, regulations, and standards etc. from credible literature resources, published research, and patents etc. to generate solutions.
Manage concept generation and concept evaluation process, analyze and compare design alternatives/possible solutions, at the system and subsystem levels, and use measures of performance or other criteria to rank alternatives.
Execute the design strategy and project plan (work breakdown structure) to ensure timely and within-budget completion of the project.
Design a system to meet the design criteria and constraints (such as cost, economic, resource availability, environment, sustainability, safety, manufacturability, assembly, reliability, testing and maintenance, and product life cycle considerations).
Execute manufacturing/ simulation/ implementation plan by selecting the suitable manufacturing/ simulation/ implementation techniques.
Verification and validation of the project objectives according to the relevant engineering standards/ requirements/ design criteria.
Understand the significance of relevant engineering standards for materials, components, manufacturing and product qualification.
Understand the major characteristics of engineering drawings and generate engineering drawings according to the technical drawing standards (layout, assembly drawing, parts drawings, etc.)
Manage design documentation and communication (both orally and in writing) using language and graphics appropriate to the technical discipline, with the necessary supporting material, to achieve desired understanding and impact.</p>
